# Healthcare-Dashboard
Key Points

**Data Overview and Requirements**  
The project began with an overview of the healthcare dataset, highlighting the differences between inpatient and outpatient data. 

**Data Collection Process**  
I demonstrated how to collect data using Power BI, emphasizing the importance of selecting the correct data connectors. I imported multiple Excel files from a structured folder, ensuring that all relevant data was collated effectively into Power BI.

**Data Transformation and Modeling**  
After collecting the data, I utilized the Power Query Editor to perform various transformation processes. This included renaming columns and appending datasets. I also focused on data modeling, creating relationships between different tables to facilitate effective data analysis.

**Visualization Blueprint Creation**  
In this phase, I developed a design strategy for the dashboard, creating a visualization blueprint that included a summary page and a detailed analysis page. I designed key visualizations to present insights on patient waiting time trends.

**Dashboard Design and Interactivity**  
I guided the design of the dashboard in Power BI, paying close attention to layout, color themes, and interactivity features such as slicers. I introduced dynamic measures for metrics like average versus median waiting times, enhancing the dashboard's usability.

This project not only enhanced my Power BI skills but also provided valuable insights into the healthcare sector's data analysis needs.
